<p>Hi there, my name is James Kouletsis and I am a sophomore majoring in business accounting at the University of Maine at Orono and I am enjoying my second semester this year. My new classes are interesting so far and will challenge me to work and get good grades. In my free time I like to play video games and play sports such as basketball and soccer.</p>
